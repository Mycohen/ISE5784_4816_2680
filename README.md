3D Ray Tracing Renderer

This project implements a 3D ray tracing renderer in Java, designed for creating realistic computer-generated imagery.
Features

Geometric primitives and shapes (Sphere, Plane, Triangle, Polygon, Tube)
Camera system for scene viewing
Multiple light types (Ambient, Directional, Point, Spot)
Material properties for realistic object rendering
Optimization techniques including Bounding Boxes and BVH

Getting Started

Clone the repository
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
Compile the Java files
Run the main application file (not provided in the given source code)

Usage
Create a scene by defining geometries, lights, and camera settings. Use the renderer to generate the final image.
