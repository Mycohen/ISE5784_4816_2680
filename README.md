# 3D Ray Tracing Renderer

This project implements a 3D ray tracing renderer in Java, designed for creating realistic computer-generated imagery.

![Final Image with 9 samples](images/0Final%20Image%20with%209%20sample%20.png)

## Features

- Geometric primitives and shapes (Sphere, Plane, Triangle, Polygon, Tube)
- Camera system for scene viewing
- Multiple light types (Ambient, Directional, Point, Spot)
- Material properties for realistic object rendering
- Optimization techniques including Bounding Boxes and BVH

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
3. Compile the Java files
4. Run the main application file (not provided in the given source code)

## Usage

Create a scene by defining geometries, lights, and camera settings. Use the renderer to generate the final image.
